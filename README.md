# üè• ONLINE BOOKING DOCTOR API

A robust API for an online doctor appointment booking system, facilitating seamless interaction between patients, doctors, and public users.

---

## üîí Security and Authentication

This API uses **Bearer Token** authentication for all secure endpoints. You must include a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header of your requests in the format: `Bearer <your_token>`.

### Logout Security Enhancement

We have implemented the **AuthorizeV1Filter** for the logout endpoint (`/api/Account/Logout`). This ensures that only authenticated users can initiate a logout, correctly invalidating the session or token and protecting against unauthorized access to this critical security feature.

### Account Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/api/Account/Register` | Register a new user (Patient or Doctor). | Public |
| `POST` | `/api/Account/Login` | Authenticate a user and receive a token. | Public |
| `POST` | `/api/Account/Logout` | Invalidate the current user's session/token. | Authenticated |
| `GET` | `/api/Account/me` | Retrieve the current user's details. | Authenticated |
| `GET` | `/api/Account/EmailExists` | Check if an email is already registered. | Public |
