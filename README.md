A robust API for an online doctor appointment booking system, facilitating seamless interaction between patients, doctors, and public users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

Built on the latest .NET Core, the API employs a clean, layered architecture for separation of concerns and testability.

| Category | Technology | Badge | Why we chose it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | **.NET 9** (C#) | ![.NET](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-512BD4?style=for-the-badge&logo=dotnet&logoColor=white) | Performance, robustness, and a powerful ecosystem. |
| **Database** | **SQL Server** | ![SQL Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL_Server-CC2927?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-sql-server&logoColor=white) | Reliability and transactional integrity for core content. |
| **ORM** | **Entity Framework Core** | ![Entity Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Entity%20Framework-447943?style=for-the-badge) | Fluent, type-safe data access and migration management. |
| **Authentication**| **JWT Bearer** | ![Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Security-JWT-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge&logo=json-web-tokens) | Secure, stateless authentication for all endpoints. |

## üîí Security and Authentication

This API uses **Bearer Token** authentication for all secure endpoints. You must include a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header of your requests in the format: `Bearer <your_token>`.

### Logout Security Enhancement

We have implemented the **AuthorizeV1Filter** for the logout endpoint (`/api/Account/Logout`). This ensures that only authenticated users can initiate a logout, correctly invalidating the session or token and protecting against unauthorized access to this critical security feature.

### Account Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/api/Account/Register` | Register a new user (Patient or Doctor). | Public |
| `POST` | `/api/Account/Login` | Authenticate a user and receive a token. | Public |
| `POST` | `/api/Account/Logout` | Invalidate the current user's session/token. | Authenticated |
| `GET` | `/api/Account/me` | Retrieve the current user's details. | Authenticated |
| `GET` | `/api/Account/EmailExists` | Check if an email is already registered. | Public |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the BlogSphere API locally.

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
* **Git**
* **SQL Server** instance (or set up a different provider in your connection string)

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Omar-Abdo1/OnlineBookingDoctorAPI.git](https://github.com/Omar-Abdo1/OnlineBookingDoctorAPI.git)
    cd BlogAPI
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment**
    Create or modify your `appsettings.Development.json` (or use `dotnet user-secrets`) to set up your database connection string and JWT key.

    ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=YourServer;Database=BlogDB;User Id=...;Password=..."
      },
      "Token": {
        "Key": "A_VERY_LONG_AND_SECURE_JWT_KEY_HERE_MIN_128_BITS",
        "Issuer": "https://localhost:5001/"
      }
    }
    ```
    *It is highly recommended to use the `dotnet user-secrets` tool to store sensitive data.*

3.  **Run Database Migrations**
    Initialize your database schema using Entity Framework Core tools.
    ```sh
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

4.  **Launch the API**
    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```
    The API should now be running and accessible at `https://localhost:5001`. You can access the **Swagger UI** for testing at `https://localhost:5001/swagger`.
